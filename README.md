# Star-Wars-Survey
A short project using python to analyze data on viewership of the star wars movies. We'll be using a dataset on the Star Wars franchise gathered by FiveThirtyEight via SurveyMonkey to address the question, "does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?"

The steps employed in this analysis are:
1. ### Data Cleaning: ### 
    - Change column names to make the project more readable and easier to work with
    - Converting survey style checkbox responses into tabular boolean data
2. ### Analysis: ###
    - Visualized several aggregate metrics of the dataset
    - Segmented the population of survey respondents and examined similarities and differences in behavior between them
  
  
Overall, the data indicates that America does think that **Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back** is the best movie!
